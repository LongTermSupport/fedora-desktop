# Ansible Lint Configuration for fedora-desktop project
# This configuration focuses on critical issues while ignoring cosmetic style rules

# Skip cosmetic and stylistic rules that don't affect functionality
# FQCN checks are ENABLED to enforce best practices
skip_list:
  - key-order[play]              # Play key order is cosmetic
  - yaml[line-length]            # Allow longer lines for readability
  - yaml[trailing-spaces]        # Minor formatting issue
  - name[casing]                 # Task name casing is stylistic
  - name[template]               # Allow flexible task naming

# Warn about these instead of failing (useful but not critical)
warn_list:
  - command-instead-of-module    # Sometimes raw commands are necessary
  - no-changed-when              # Good practice but not always critical
  - risky-shell-pipe             # Shell pipes are sometimes needed
  - jinja[spacing]               # Jinja spacing is in default warn_list

# Enable FQCN checks (move from warn to fail)
enable_list:
  - fqcn[action-core]
  - fqcn[action]
  - fqcn

# Use 'production' profile - comprehensive checks including FQCN
profile: production

# Exclude directories that shouldn't be linted
exclude_paths:
  - .git/
  - untracked/
  - .cache/
  - venv/
  - .venv/

# Enable offline mode if you don't want to check for rule updates
offline: false

# Set parseable output for easier parsing
# Can be overridden with -f flag
# format: pep8
