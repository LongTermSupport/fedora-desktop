# src-go project rules (Defence Before Fix)

Defect classes the `ccy-teams` and `ccy-sessions` ports actually hit, each held by a
`go/analysis` analyzer in `src-go/qa/rules`. They run from `scripts/qa-go.bash` as a hard
step: the driver (`src-go/qa/driver`) is built once and used as `go vet -vettool` over
`src-go`. Every finding fails the gate. There is no inline suppression: the only excuse is a
row in a table in `src-go/qa/rules/table.go`, with its reason.

**A new defect class found in `src-go` gets a rule here before its fix.** Write the rule, prove
it red on a fixture reproducing the defect (`src-go/qa/rules/testdata/src`, run by
`analysistest`), then green on the real tree, fixing every real instance it finds. A rule is
also red-tested against the ways round it: a rule that holds only against the original
spelling of the defect is documentation, not a gate.

The rules live in their own module (`src-go/qa`, its own `go.mod`, depending on
`golang.org/x/tools`) because the shipped binaries are built on the host with plain `go build`
and `src-go/go.mod` must stay dependency-free. `qa-go.bash` checks that module too (format,
vet, test, coverage, lint). This file is under `CLAUDE/` because the markdown guard allows no
`.md` beside the Go code.

## Fit with go-qa-ci

go-qa-ci documents project analyzers as a project driver package, analyzers proven with
`analysistest`, and one page per analyzer under its `docs_dir`. The analyzers and their
`analysistest` proofs match, and the names are identifier-only (`project_*`), so adopting it is
a change of driver (`driver.Main(rules.All()...)` in place of `unitchecker.Main`). Gaps, because
of the dependency-free constraint on `src-go/go.mod`: go-qa-ci expects the driver in the
project's own module (`[analyzers] driver`) and here it sits in the nested `src-go/qa` module,
which its per-module run (`modules` in `qa/go-qa.toml`) must be told about; and the per-rule
pages are not written, this catalogue stands in until adoption.

## The rules

| Rule                    | Defect class                                                                                                                        | Found in                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `project_seam_exec`     | a process started outside the runner, so no fake sees it                                                                            | `teams`: `syscall.Exec` in the launcher hand-over                              |
| `project_seam_commands` | a program run outside the package that owns it, or a command the rule cannot judge (run-time name, hidden wrapper argv, shell `-c`) | `sessions`: `systemctl reboot`; `teams`: the take-down heading via `gum style` |
| `project_tmux_targets`  | a tmux `-t` target in the wrong form for its command (fedora-desktop#69)                                                            | the bash library, before the port                                              |
| `project_testclock`     | wall-clock reads in tests (date-dependent tests failed in the hour after midnight)                                                  | `transcript` and `sessprobe` tests: 23 `time.Now()` fixtures                   |
| `project_homeabbrev`    | a hand-rolled `~` home abbreviation (a bare prefix replace turned `/home/<user>X` into `~X`)                                        | `teams` tests: `strings.Replace(..., "~", 1)` twice                            |

Each rule's doc string (`go vet -vettool=<driver> help project_<name>`) says what it does and
does not catch; the sections below are the same facts with their proofs. Anything a rule does
not catch is listed under it, so the catalogue claims no more than the code does.

### project_seam_exec

Outside `internal/execx`, any reference (a call, a function value, an argument, an assignment)
to `exec.Command`, `exec.CommandContext`, `syscall.Exec`, `syscall.ForkExec`,
`syscall.StartProcess` or `os.StartProcess`; any use of the `os/exec.Cmd` type (composite
literal, `new(exec.Cmd)`, a parameter); and the `Run`, `Start`, `Output` and `CombinedOutput`
methods of one. Matching is by `types.Info` object, so an import alias or a dot import does not
hide it. `exec.LookPath` is allowed anywhere.

- Red, fixture: `testdata/src/fix/internal/badexec` (`bad.go` the direct calls, `evade.go` the
  function value, the `exec.Cmd` literal and `.Run`, `new(exec.Cmd)`, a method value,
  `ForkExec`, `StartProcess`; `LookPath` clean; the owner `execx` clean).
- Red, real tree: `internal/teams/app.go:274: syscall.Exec outside internal/execx`.
- Green: `execLauncher` now hands over through `execx.Execer` (`launcherVia`, tested with the
  fake).
- Not caught: raw `syscall.Syscall(SYS_EXECVE, ...)`, cgo, and a process started by code in a
  dependency (`src-go` has none). An `sh -c` string handed to the runner is not a process start
  here; `project_seam_commands` flags it.

### project_seam_commands

For an `execx.Cmd` built outside `internal/execx` (a composite literal, keyed or unkeyed, or an
assignment to `.Name`; test files are exempt, a test spells out the argv it expects):

- `Name` must be a compile-time constant (`go/constant` through `types.Info`: a literal, a named
  constant, a constant expression). A `Name` chosen at run time is a finding unless the function
  has a row in `dynamicNames` (package, function or `Type.method`, reason). A dynamic `Name` is
  not judged against the owner table; each row's reason says what it can be.
- The program is judged by its base name: `/usr/bin/gum` and `./bin/tmux` are `gum` and `tmux`.
- A wrapper is seen through to the program it runs: `env [-u X] [VAR=val] prog`,
  `sudo [-flags] prog`, `timeout [-s S] DURATION prog`, `nice [-n N] prog`, `setsid prog`,
  `nohup prog` and `systemd-run [options] -- prog`, nested. The wrapper's argv must be a literal,
  or `append` / `slices.Concat` of literals, that shows the program; otherwise the rule reports
  `cannot see which program "env" runs` (so `declare` writes its `env` argv inline).
- An owned program may be run only by its owner (the `commandOwners` table): `sudo` by
  `internal/sudo`, `tmux` by `internal/tmuxccy`, `gum` and `fzf` by `internal/ui`, `systemctl`
  and `busctl` by `internal/systemd`, `git` by `internal/gitx`, `ps` and `docker` by
  `internal/sessprobe`, `podman` by `internal/sessprobe` (a session's container) and
  `internal/podfreeze` (pause, unpause, networks: a table entry may list several owners), and the
  `lxc-*` tools and `nmcli` by `internal/lxcfreeze`. Any other program (`wl-copy`, `gh`, `id`, `tput`, `systemd-escape`,
  `python3`, ...) is unowned and free. The owner's own program is trusted: what the owner puts
  after it is not examined here.
- A shell with `-c` (`sh`, `bash`, `dash`, `zsh`), directly or behind a wrapper, is flagged: it is
  the `sh -c` route round the argv the runner shows.

`LookPath("gum")` and text containing a program's name are not commands and are not flagged.

- Red, fixture: `testdata/src/fix/internal/badcmd` (every form above flagged, with the clean
  neighbours: `wl-copy`, `systemd-escape`, `env PYTHONPATH=... python3`,
  `systemd-run -- setsid gio`, `bash script.bash`; the `_test.go` file clean), the owner
  `sudo`, `other/internal/tmuxccy` (the owner running tmux, directly and under `systemd-run`,
  clean; running `git` flagged) and `dynamic` (a `dynamicNames` row clean, its neighbour flagged).
- Red, real tree: `internal/sessions/reboot.go:199` (`systemctl`),
  `internal/teams/takedown.go:105` (`gum`); after the rule was hardened, `busctl` and `ps` run
  from `sessions`, `podman`/`docker` queried from `sessions`, `env` hiding `python3` in `declare`,
  `systemd-run` hiding `tmux` in `tmuxccy`, and seven run-time names.
- Green: `systemd.Reboot` and `systemd.CanReboot`, `sessprobe.ProcessTable` and
  `sessprobe.RunningContainerNames` (new, tested), the existing `ui.Gum.Box`; the engine query
  in `sessions` now runs through `sessprobe`; the remaining run-time names (the container engine in
  `sessprobe`, the project's daemon CLI, the launcher, two plays) are six `dynamicNames` rows.
- Not caught: an `execx.Cmd` built by copying another; the flags and arguments an owner uses
  (below).

What the owners do with their program is held by their own tests, not by this rule: `sudo -n` is
asserted in `internal/sudo`'s tests (`TestAsRootRunsSudoN`, `TestRunAfterReadyUsesSudoN`; the
`Ready` probe is `-n -v`, and only its prompt, `-v`, omits `-n`, deliberately). No analyzer checks it, and the tmux argument forms by `project_tmux_targets`.

### project_tmux_targets

In `internal/tmuxccy`, the only package that builds tmux argv: the `-t` target of a pane command
(`capture-pane`, `send-keys`, ...) must be `paneTarget(name)` (`=name:`, the colon is required:
real tmux refuses the bare `=name` for panes), and the `-t` target of a session command
(`kill-session`, `list-clients`, `attach-session`, ...) must be `"=" + name`, with no colon. The
commands are classified in the `paneCommands` and `sessionCommands` tables. A `-t` beside a
command in neither table is flagged so the table is extended, and so is a function that builds
both kinds, so each target can be judged. `-s` targets (`detach-client -s`, a session) are not
checked.

- Red, fixture: `testdata/src/fix/internal/tmuxccy` (good pane and session forms clean; bare
  `=name` for a pane, `paneTarget` or `=name:` or a bare name for a session, a mixed function and
  an unclassified command flagged).
- Real tree: clean. The review claimed `tmuxccy/panes.go:84` (`"="+name`) was a missing colon; it
  is `kill-session`, a session command, so `=name` is the correct form.
- Judged per function: the command words found in the function against the `-t` in the same
  argument list. Not caught: a target built elsewhere and passed in, and an argv assembled from a
  variable. `scripts/test-ccy-tmux-targets.bash` runs the real forms against a real tmux.

### project_testclock

Any reference to `time.Now`, `time.Since` or `time.Until` in a `_test.go` file: a call, a function
value (`n := time.Now`), an argument (`stamp(time.Now)`), a struct field, a package-level
initialiser. Excuse: a `clockAllowances` row (package, test function, reason). One row exists,
`TestTakeOverDefaultsToTheRealClockAndSleep`, which proves the default `Sleep` really sleeps and
can only do that against the wall clock. A package-level declaration cannot be excused.

- Red, fixture: `testdata/src/fix/internal/badclock` (the three calls; the function value,
  argument, field, package-level `var` and closure forms in `evade_test.go`; `time.Date` and
  production code clean) and `allowedclock` (the allowed function clean, its neighbour flagged).
- Red, real tree: 23 findings in `transcript_test.go` and `sessprobe/join_test.go`.
- Green: fixed instants (`fixedMtime`, `sampledAt`).
- Not caught: a clock read in a non-test helper; production takes its clock through a seam.

### project_homeabbrev

Outside `internal/term` (which owns `term.AbbrevHome`), test files included, with a string
constant that is `"~"` or begins `~` (or the rune `'~'`): `strings.Replace`, `ReplaceAll`,
`NewReplacer`, `TrimPrefix`, `HasPrefix`, `CutPrefix`, `TrimLeft`, `Trim`; any `fmt` formatter
(`Sprintf("~%s", p)`); `path.Join` and `filepath.Join`; `WriteString`, `WriteByte` and
`WriteRune` on a `strings.Builder` or `bytes.Buffer`; and a non-constant string concatenation whose
leftmost operand is such a constant (`"~" + rest`).

- Red, fixture: `testdata/src/fix/internal/badhome` (`bad.go` the five original functions,
  `evade.go` the concatenation, formatters, builder and buffer writes, trim, replacer and join; a
  `_test.go` flagged, an unrelated `Replace` and a `~` that does not begin the text clean; the
  owner `term` clean).
- Red, real tree: `internal/teams/collect_test.go:270`, `element_test.go:47`.
- Green: both use `term.AbbrevHome`.
- Not caught: a `~` assembled from non-constant pieces (`string(rune(126))`, a variable). A
  legitimate "does the answer begin with `~`" check has no exit but `internal/term`; add an
  allowance table of the same shape as the others when one is needed.

## Control

`scripts/qa-go.bash` was run with `strings.HasPrefix(p, "~")` planted in a package outside
`internal/term`: every earlier step passed and the gate failed at the rules step with a
`project_homeabbrev` finding. The plant was removed. After the rules were hardened a test file
with `var now = time.Now`, `"~" + rest` and `f := exec.Command` was planted in a package and all
three were reported; it was removed.
