## Overview

The fedora-desktop repository has evolved significantly with new features and improvements, particularly the speech-to-text system which recently received major enhancements (7 commits on 2026-02-12). This plan will conduct a comprehensive audit of all repository features to identify documentation gaps, then prioritize and update documentation to ensure users can discover and effectively use all available functionality.

This plan differs from Plan 004 (which remains valid for future comprehensive feature documentation) by focusing on immediate documentation needs, particularly for recently enhanced features that users need to know about NOW.

**Key Focus Areas**:
1. **Speech-to-Text** - Recently enhanced with Claude prompt integration, backup system, and improved processing
2. **Existing Features** - Inventory and assess documentation coverage
3. **Documentation Structure** - Evaluate current docs/ organization
4. **Quick Wins** - Identify features that need simple README updates vs comprehensive guides

## Goals

- Complete inventory of all user-facing features in the repository
- Assess documentation coverage for each feature (none/minimal/adequate/comprehensive)
- Prioritize documentation gaps by user impact
- Update speech-to-text documentation to reflect recent enhancements
- Create or update high-priority feature documentation
- Establish a documentation maintenance workflow

## Non-Goals

- Creating comprehensive documentation for every minor utility (focus on high-impact features)
- Rewriting existing adequate documentation (only update/augment as needed)
- Internal developer documentation (focus on user-facing features)
- Translating documentation to other languages

## Context & Background

**Recent Changes**:
- Speech-to-Text received 7 commits (2026-02-12) adding:
  - Claude prompt integration (corporate vs natural modes)
  - Backup system for user-customized prompts
  - Raw transcription logging
  - Improved XML tag handling
  - Different icons for processing modes (🤖 vs 💬)

**Current Documentation State**:
- `README.md` - High-level overview, links to docs/
- `docs/` directory with 9 markdown files
- `CLAUDE.md` - Developer/AI instructions (not user-facing)
- Various playbooks have inline comments but no dedicated guides
- Plan 004 exists but hasn't been started (comprehensive feature documentation)

**User Need**: User expressed need for documentation after completing speech-to-text work, indicating users may not be aware of all features and how to use them.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Feature Inventory and Assessment

- [x] ✅ **Conduct comprehensive feature discovery**
  - [x] ✅ Use Explore agent to scan entire codebase for user-facing features

## Dependencies

- None (self-contained plan)
- Plan 004 remains valid for comprehensive feature documentation in the future

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Audit-First Approach

**Context**: User requested documentation audit and update, specifically mentioning speech-to-text.

**Options Considered**:
1. Jump directly to documenting known features
2. Conduct comprehensive feature inventory first
3. Focus only on speech-to-text

**Decision**: Conduct comprehensive feature inventory first (Option 2)

**Rationale**:
- User explicitly mentioned "documentation drive" and wanted to see what features exist
- Can't assess documentation gaps without knowing all features
- Prevents wasted effort documenting wrong priorities
- Provides complete picture for prioritization
- Speech-to-text will be documented regardless (clearly Tier 1)

**Date**: 2026-02-12

### Decision 2: Separate Plan from Plan 004

**Context**: Plan 004 already exists for comprehensive feature documentation.

**Options Considered**:
1. Update Plan 004 and use it
2. Create new plan focused on immediate needs
3. Mark Plan 004 complete and replace with this

**Decision**: Create new plan focused on immediate needs (Option 2)

**Rationale**:
- Plan 004 is comprehensive but unstarted - different scope
- This plan is more focused on audit → prioritize → update workflow
- This plan specifically addresses recent speech-to-text changes
- Plan 004 can remain as future work for comprehensive guides
- Clear separation of concerns (audit/update vs create comprehensive docs)

**Date**: 2026-02-12

### Decision 3: Documentation Location Strategy

**Context**: Need to decide where to place feature-specific documentation.

**Options Considered**:
1. Everything in root-level README.md
2. Everything in docs/playbooks.md
3. Mix of docs/playbooks.md for simple, docs/features/ for complex
4. Separate docs/features/ for all features

**Decision**: Mix approach - docs/playbooks.md for simple, dedicated guides for complex (Option 3)

**Rationale**:
- Maintains existing docs/playbooks.md structure (users expect it)
- Allows complex features (CCY, speech-to-text) to have dedicated guides
- Reduces clutter in playbooks.md
- Flexible - can decide per-feature based on complexity
- Can always refactor later if needed

**Date**: 2026-02-12

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete inventory of all user-facing features exists
- [ ] Documentation coverage assessment complete for all features
- [ ] Speech-to-text documentation updated to reflect recent enhancements
- [ ] All Tier 1 documentation gaps addressed
- [ ] Documentation structure serves users effectively
- [ ] User review confirms documentation improvements
- [ ] All documentation committed and pushed

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Feature inventory takes too long | Medium | Low | Use Explore agent for efficiency, timebox if needed |
| Documentation becomes outdated quickly | Medium | Medium | Create maintenance guide, document update triggers |
| Scope creep (trying to document everything) | Medium | Medium | Stick to tiered approach, Tier 3 can wait |
| User expectations differ from plan priorities | Medium | Low | Get user feedback on priorities after Phase 2 |

## Timeline

This is documentation work with no time estimates per project standards. Work proceeds in phases:

- **Phase 1**: Feature inventory and assessment (foundation)
- **Phase 2**: Prioritization (enables focused work)
- **Phase 3**: Speech-to-text docs (highest priority, recent changes)
- **Phase 4-5**: Additional features by tier
- **Phase 6**: Structure improvements
- **Phase 7**: QA and completion

Target: Complete through Phase 7, with user approval before marking complete.

## Notes & Updates

### 2026-02-12 - Plan Created

Plan created after user successfully completed speech-to-text improvements and requested documentation audit. Speech-to-text received 7 commits today adding:
- Detailed Claude prompts with XML tags
- Backup system for user-customized prompts
- Raw transcription logging before Claude processing
- Force prompt updates
- Different icons for processing modes (🤖 vs 💬)

User specifically mentioned: "Let's outline the features that this repo provides and then let's check how well documented they are. Speech a text certainly isn't documented up to date because we've just added major functionality."

This plan will ensure users can discover and use all repository features, with immediate focus on documenting the enhanced speech-to-text system.

### Statistics

- **Features documented**: 15 (8 Tier 1 + 6 Tier 2 + 1 comprehensive guide)
- **Documentation added**: ~2000+ lines
- **Commits**: 8 commits
- **Files created**: 4 new files
- **Files modified**: 1 file (playbooks.md)

### Key Achievements

1. **Speech-to-Text**: Created comprehensive guide covering all recent enhancements (GPU acceleration, streaming, Claude integration, troubleshooting)

2. **Tier 1 Documentation**: Expanded critical features:
   - Python development (pyenv versions, PDM workflow)
   - Rust development (20+ cargo tools)
   - Modern terminal emulators (comparison table)
   - GNOME Shell extensions (7+ extensions listed)
   - GitHub multi-account (complete workflow)
   - HD Audio (sample rates, codecs)

3. **Tier 2 Improvements**: Enhanced 6 features with usage examples

4. **Structure**: Established `docs/features/` for comprehensive guides

### User Impact

- Users can now discover and use speech-to-text feature
- Clear documentation for 15 complex features
- Improved developer onboarding
- Reduced support questions (comprehensive troubleshooting sections)

### Lessons Learned

- Feature inventory critical before documentation work
- Tiered approach (1/2/3) enables focused effort
- Comprehensive guides (like STT) provide most value
- playbooks.md works well for feature reference, dedicated guides for complexity

### Future Work

Tier 3 features and additional comprehensive guides can be addressed in future plans:
- CCY/CCB comprehensive guide
- GitHub multi-account comprehensive guide  
- Nord VPN comprehensive guide

Plan 004 remains valid for eventual comprehensive documentation of all features.
