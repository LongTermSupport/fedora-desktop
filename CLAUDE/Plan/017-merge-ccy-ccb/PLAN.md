# Plan 017: Retire CCB and CCB-Browser — Single CCY Tool

**Status**: 🔄 In Progress
**Created**: 2026-02-21
**Owner**: Claude Code
**Priority**: High

## Overview

CCY (Claude Code YOLO) and CCB (Claude Code Browser) have diverged into two parallel systems that are expensive to maintain. Every fix applied to CCY must be manually ported to CCB, and drift consistently accumulates — the `installMethod` bug fixed today (CCY used `"native"`, CCB used `"npm"`) is a clear example.

The two systems share ~95% of their code and infrastructure. The only meaningful difference is that CCB adds Playwright, all browser binaries, the Playwright MCP server, and chrome-ws on top of the same CCY base. CCB's wrapper (`claude-browser`) is a near-copy of CCY's wrapper (`claude-yolo`) with identical logic.

This plan retires **both** CCB (Docker-based browser container) and `claude-yolo-browser` (distrobox-based Playwright tool), merging agent-browser capability directly into CCY. The result: one Dockerfile, one wrapper (`ccy`), one Ansible deployment section. No aliases, no compatibility shims — clean cut.

## Goals

- Single Dockerfile replacing both `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.browser`
- Single wrapper script `ccy` / `claude-yolo` — `ccb` deleted, not aliased
- Single entrypoint `entrypoint.sh` handling all cases
- Single Ansible playbook section (all browser-specific tasks removed)
- Wayland GUI mounts included in the merged `claude-yolo` wrapper
- All documentation updated to describe only CCY
- `claude-yolo-browser` / `ccyb` distrobox tool also removed (maintained experiment, never used)

## Non-Goals

- Keeping a `ccb` command, alias, or symlink — CCB is gone
- Keeping a `ccyb` / `ccy-browser` command — distrobox tool also removed
- Keeping Playwright framework or its full browser suite
- Keeping the Playwright MCP server (`@playwright/mcp@latest`) — context-window bloat
- Keeping chrome-ws — agent-browser covers the use case at a higher level
- Adding new browser automation features beyond agent-browser

## Context & Background

**Why agent-browser and not Playwright MCP?**
The Playwright MCP server exposes browser state via MCP protocol, consuming significant context window on every tool call. agent-browser is a standalone CLI that Claude calls as a shell command — zero MCP overhead, token-efficient interface.

**Why remove chrome-ws?**
chrome-ws is a raw Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) client requiring a browser already running with `--remote-debugging-port`. agent-browser manages the full browser lifecycle. No use case requires raw CDP that agent-browser cannot satisfy. YAGNI.

**Why delete CCB entirely rather than alias it?**
Keeping `ccb` as an alias perpetuates the mental model of two systems. The point is to simplify to one thing. Users adapt; clean cuts are better than compatibility shims.

**Why delete claude-yolo-browser too?**
It's a maintained experiment that's never used. Removing it completes the simplification: CCY is the only thing.

**Safe rollback tag**: `stable-2026-02-20` (commit `a6ec2c9`) — last known-good state before today's work.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Audit Current State ✅

- [x] ✅ **Task 1.1**: Diff `Dockerfile` vs `Dockerfile.browser` — list every addition CCB makes
- [x] ✅ **Task 1.2**: Diff `claude-yolo` vs `claude-browser` — list every CCB-specific block
- [x] ✅ **Task 1.3**: Diff `entrypoint.sh` vs `entrypoint-browser.sh` — list differences

- [x] ✅ **Task 6.4**: `files/home/bashrc-includes/claude-yolo.bash.j2` — confirmed no CCB references (clean)

### Phase 7: Update Documentation 🔄

All docs must be updated in **both** locations: the repo source files and the copies baked into containers / deployed to hosts.

- [x] ✅ **Task 7.1**: Rewrite `files/opt/claude-yolo/docs/CCY-CCB-GUIDE.txt` — CCY-only guide
- [x] ✅ **Task 7.3**: Rewrite `files/opt/claude-yolo/docs/CUSTOM-DOCKERFILES.txt` — CCY only

- [x] ✅ **Task 7.9**: Grep sweep + user-facing docs cleanup:
  - [x] ✅ `docs/installation.md` — removed deleted `play-distrobox-playwright.yml` reference
  - [x] ✅ `docs/README.md` — removed Playwright references
  - [x] ✅ `.claude/README.md` — updated deleted file example
  - [x] ✅ `playbooks/imports/optional/common/play-install-distrobox.yml` — removed deleted playbook echo

### Phase 8: Remove claude-yolo-browser (Distrobox Tool) ✅

New scope: `claude-yolo-browser` (the `ccyb` / `ccy-browser` distrobox-based Playwright tool) is also being removed. It was a maintained experiment that's never used.

- [x] ✅ **Task 8.1**: Delete `files/var/local/claude-yolo/claude-yolo-browser` wrapper script
- [x] ✅ **Task 8.2**: Delete `files/home/bashrc-includes/claude-yolo-browser.bash` bashrc include
- [x] ✅ **Task 8.3**: Delete `playbooks/imports/optional/common/play-distrobox-playwright.yml`
- [x] ✅ **Task 8.4**: Add cleanup tasks to Ansible (`play-install-claude-yolo.yml`) for deployed distrobox artifacts on target hosts
- [x] ✅ **Task 8.5**: Remaining references found and being cleaned up (see Task 7.9)

### Phase 9: QA and Final Commit ⬜

- [ ] ⬜ **Task 9.1**: Run `./scripts/qa-all.bash` — all checks pass
- [ ] ⬜ **Task 9.2**: Run `./scripts/qa-ctrl-z-patch.bash` — ctrl+z patch still applies
- [ ] ⬜ **Task 9.3**: Grep entire repo for `ccb`, `claude-browser`, `ccyb`, `ccy-browser`, `claude-yolo-browser` — confirm clean
- [ ] ⬜ **Task 9.4**: Commit all changes with reference to this plan

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Remove Playwright MCP, Keep agent-browser
**Context**: CCB included `@playwright/mcp@latest` as an MCP server. MCP servers consume context window on every browser tool call. agent-browser is a CLI — no MCP overhead.
**Decision**: Remove Playwright MCP entirely. Keep `npm install -g agent-browser && agent-browser install` for Chromium browser automation via CLI.
**Date**: 2026-02-21

### Decision 2: Remove chrome-ws
**Context**: chrome-ws is a raw CDP client. agent-browser provides higher-level control and manages its own browser lifecycle.
**Decision**: Remove chrome-ws. YAGNI.
**Date**: 2026-02-21

### Decision 3: Delete CCB entirely — no alias, no symlink
**Context**: Keeping `ccb` as a compatibility alias perpetuates the two-system mental model and adds maintenance surface.
**Decision**: CCB is deleted outright. Only `ccy` / `claude-yolo` remains. Clean cut.
**Date**: 2026-02-21

### Decision 4: Wayland mounts conditional in merged wrapper
**Context**: CCB conditionally added Wayland mounts when `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` was set. Same logic moves into `claude-yolo`.
**Decision**: Add CCB's Wayland detection block to `claude-yolo`. Falls back gracefully when no display is available (headless/SSH sessions).
**Date**: 2026-02-21

### Decision 5: Remove claude-yolo-browser distrobox tool
**Context**: `claude-yolo-browser` (`ccyb`) is a Playwright-distrobox-based tool that was built as an experiment. It's never used in practice.
**Decision**: Delete it entirely. CCY with agent-browser covers all real browser automation needs. Complete simplification: one tool.
**Date**: 2026-02-21

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `ccy` launches container with agent-browser available and functional
- [ ] agent-browser can launch Chromium inside the merged container
- [ ] Wayland browser windows visible on host when using Wayland
- [ ] ctrl+z patch applied correctly in merged image
- [ ] No files, scripts, images, or tasks referencing `ccb`, `claude-browser`, `ccyb`, `ccy-browser`, or `claude-yolo-browser` remain
- [ ] `./scripts/qa-all.bash` passes
- [ ] `./scripts/qa-ctrl-z-patch.bash` passes
- [ ] Ansible playbook deploys cleanly

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Merged image too large | Med | Low | agent-browser installs Chromium only, not Firefox/WebKit |
| agent-browser Wayland config broken | Med | Med | Config is copied verbatim from CCB; test on host before committing |
| ctrl+z patch incompatible with new npm packages | Low | Low | `qa-ctrl-z-patch.bash` catches this |
| Missed CCB reference in docs/scripts | Low | Med | Phase 9.3 grep sweep catches stragglers |
