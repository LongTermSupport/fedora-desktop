## Plan Lifecycle

### 1. Create

- Create folder: `CLAUDE/Plan/NNNNN-description/`
- Write `PLAN.md` with tasks, goals, and status
- Add entry to `README.md` under **Active Plans**

### 2. Execute

- Work through tasks
- Update task status in `PLAN.md` as you go
- Reference plan in commits: `Plan NNNNN: Description`

### 3. Complete

When all tasks are done:

1. Update plan status to `Complete` with date
2. Move folder to `CLAUDE/Plan/Completed/NNNNN-description/`
3. Update `README.md`: remove from Active, add to Completed, update stats
4. Commit the move

```bash
git mv CLAUDE/Plan/NNNNN-desc CLAUDE/Plan/Completed/NNNNN-desc
```
