# ⚠️  DO NOT ADD SUPPRESSIONS HERE UNLESS THE ISSUE GENUINELY CANNOT BE FIXED.
#     NO SHORTCUTS. Fix the code properly instead.
#
# Valid reasons to suppress:
#   - Intentional word splitting that cannot be refactored to an array
#   - Dynamic source paths that are resolved at runtime (use source=/dev/null inline)
#   - Third-party or generated code outside our control
#
# Invalid reasons to suppress:
#   - "It's too much work to fix"
#   - "It's pre-existing so it doesn't matter"
#   - "It works fine in practice"
