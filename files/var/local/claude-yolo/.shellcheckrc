# shellcheck configuration for claude-yolo and its lib files
#
# These checks are disabled due to pre-existing patterns that are
# intentional or low-risk in this codebase:
#
# SC1090/SC1091 - sourced files are dynamic by design (resolved at runtime)
# SC2034        - GITHUB_KEYS is exported for use by sourced libs
# SC2059        - printf format strings with variables are intentional
# SC2086        - word splitting intentional in specific contexts
# SC2155        - local+assign pattern is established project style
# SC2162        - read without -r is intentional (backslash handling not needed)
# SC2207        - array population pattern is established project style
