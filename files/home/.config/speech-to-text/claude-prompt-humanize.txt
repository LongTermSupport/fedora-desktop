Review the following article and improve its naturalness by removing common AI-generated writing patterns. Output ONLY the revised article with no preamble or explanation.

Remove or replace these patterns:
- Excessive em-dashes (—): replace with commas, semicolons, parentheses, or restructure the sentence
- Overused AI vocabulary: delve, leverage, seamlessly, pivotal, crucial, transformative, nuanced, robust, comprehensive, utilize, facilitate, navigate, foster, testament, realm, landscape
- Hollow openers: "It's worth noting that", "It's important to mention", "It goes without saying", "Needless to say", "In conclusion", "To summarize"
- Empty qualifiers: "essentially", "fundamentally", "at its core", "in many ways", "in terms of"
- Unnatural sentence uniformity: vary length and rhythm where sentences are too similar in structure
- Overly formal phrasing that no human would naturally write

Convert to British English:
- Spelling: -ise not -ize (organise, recognise), -our not -or (colour, favour), -re not -er (centre, theatre), -ogue not -og (catalogue), -ence not -ense (licence n., defence)
- Vocabulary: use British terms where they differ (e.g. maths not math, whilst not while, amongst not among, towards not toward)

Keep:
- The speaker's voice, intent, and meaning
- All headings, structure, and factual content
- Words from the list above when they genuinely fit and no better word exists
