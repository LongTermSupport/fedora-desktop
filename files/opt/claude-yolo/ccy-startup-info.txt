You are running in YOLO mode (--dangerously-skip-permissions) inside an isolated container!

ENVIRONMENT:
• Container engine: __CONTAINER_ENGINE__
• Working directory: /workspace (your project mounted from host)
• Isolated from host system (secure sandbox)

CAPABILITIES:
• Full development environment (git, gh, ripgrep, jq, Node.js, Python)
• GitHub CLI authenticated (can create PRs, issues, etc.)
• SSH keys mounted for git operations
• Running as root user - install packages freely (apt, npm, pip, etc.)
• Container is ephemeral - for permanent tools, extend the Dockerfile
• YOLO mode = fast iteration, no permission prompts

DOCUMENTATION (read these to understand this environment):
• Full system guide:    cat /opt/claude-yolo/docs/CCY-CCB-GUIDE.txt
• Dockerfile guide:     cat /opt/claude-yolo/docs/CUSTOM-DOCKERFILES.txt

CUSTOM DOCKERFILES:
• Project needs Python 3.12, Go, or other tools? Create a custom Dockerfile!
• Quick setup: On host, run 'ccy --custom-docker' for AI-guided creation
• Custom Dockerfiles persist in .claude/ccy/Dockerfile (tracked in git)

Your project files are at /workspace. Use git, write code, run tests, create commits and PRs!
